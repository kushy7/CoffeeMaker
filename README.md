# CoffeeMaker ‚òï

A modern, full-stack **enterprise-grade coffee shop management system** built with cutting-edge Java technologies and microservices architecture. CoffeeMaker provides a comprehensive solution for coffee shop operations with real-time inventory management, order processing, and customer relationship management.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Java 11+** (OpenJDK recommended)
- **MySQL 8.0+** 
- **Maven 3.6+** (or use included Maven Wrapper)
- **macOS/Linux/Windows** (tested on macOS)

### Installation & Setup

#### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Install MySQL (macOS with Homebrew)
brew install mysql

# Start MySQL service
brew services start mysql

# Connect to MySQL and create database
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE CoffeeMaker;
exit;
```

#### 2. Application Configuration
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd CoffeeMaker-Individual/src/main/resources/

# Copy configuration templates
cp application.yml.template application.yml
cp application.properties.template application.properties

# Edit application.properties to set staff signup key
# Default: auth.staffSignupKey=admin123
```

#### 3. Build & Run
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd CoffeeMaker-Individual/

# Make Maven wrapper executable (if needed)
chmod +x ./mvnw

# Run the application
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

#### 4. Access the Application
- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:8080
- **API Endpoints**: http://localhost:8080/api/
- **Database**: MySQL on localhost:3306

### üîß Configuration Details

The application uses Spring Boot's auto-configuration with the following key settings:

**Database Configuration** (`application.yml`):
```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    driver-class-name: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/CoffeeMaker?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true&serverTimezone=EST
    username: root
    password: 
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
      dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect
```

**Security Configuration** (`application.properties`):
```properties
auth.staffSignupKey=admin123  (or any chosen password to initialize staff member accounts)
```

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Management

#### View Database Contents
```bash
# Connect to MySQL
mysql -u root -p

# Use CoffeeMaker database
USE CoffeeMaker;

# List all tables
SHOW TABLES;

# View specific table data
SELECT * FROM staff;
SELECT * FROM customer;
SELECT * FROM recipe;
SELECT * FROM ingredient;
SELECT * FROM inventory;
```

#### Database Schema
The application automatically creates the following tables:
- `customer` - Customer account information
- `staff` - Staff user accounts and permissions
- `recipe` - Coffee recipes and pricing
- `ingredient` - Available ingredients
- `inventory` - Current inventory levels
- `customer_order` - Order tracking and status
- `session` - User session management

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Permission Denied Error
```bash
# Error: zsh: permission denied: ./mvnw
# Solution: Make Maven wrapper executable
chmod +x ./mvnw
```

#### 2. Database Connection Failed
```bash
# Error: Failed to determine a suitable driver class
# Solution: Ensure MySQL is running and database exists
brew services start mysql
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS CoffeeMaker;"
```

#### 3. Port Already in Use
```bash
# Error: Port 8080 is already in use
# Solution: Kill process using port 8080
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9
# Or change port in application.yml
```

#### 4. Configuration File Missing
```bash
# Error: No active profile set
# Solution: Copy configuration templates
cp src/main/resources/application.yml.template src/main/resources/application.yml
cp src/main/resources/application.properties.template src/main/resources/application.properties
```

### Development Commands

#### Build & Test
```bash
# Clean and compile
./mvnw clean compile

# Run tests
./mvnw test

# Package application
./mvnw package

# Run with specific profile
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```


### Code Quality Standards
- Maintain test coverage above 70%
- Follow Checkstyle guidelines
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Update documentation for new features
